USER story-

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria-

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Refactored html-

xxxxxxx
xxxxxxx

Refactored CSS-

removed all code that match to fit into one class
only code that stands out with specific identifier
CSS line 19- added color and removed redundant blocks
CSS line 33 and 38- removed header div elements unordered list and list, no other list is present so specificity is not needed for multiple blocks
